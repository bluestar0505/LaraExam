The first thing is this scroll arrow(there is also an upwards scrolling arrow with the same changes required).
When you press it, it scrolls down only a little bit, and also once you press it once. you have to hover around a bit to be able to click it again.
Furthermore, when you reach the end of the list, the arrow takes a second or 2 to actually disappear, but we would like for it to disappear immediately after reaching the bottom of the list.
Finally we would like for the cursor to become a hand instead of a click while hovering over the arrow so that the user understands they can press the arrow.
As far as the small increments in scrolling when clicking the button, we haven't decided the best way to scroll so we can leave this open to discussion.

Next this is the list that the scroller relates to.
The list is contained in a box of constant dimensions, but the list itself is expandable, so when you expand the bottom element of a list (like in the screenshot below), the expanded elements disappear off the screen.
Again we are open to discussion on how to better implement the list but right now our idea is that the list snaps so that you never see half a list element i.e. you always see all of the element or none of it.

Here we have horizontal scrollers with similar problems to the vertical scrollers.
We would like that the list snaps and that the scrollers didn't scroll in such small
Finally we just have some buttons that aren't working properly at the moment, depending on the screen they are being viewed on.
we would like to change the 'Report Issue' button to an icon of a flag also.
